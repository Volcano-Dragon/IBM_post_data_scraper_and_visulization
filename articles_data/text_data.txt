Today I was honored to welcome U.S. President Joe Biden to IBM Poughkeepsie, where we design and manufacture mainframes that power the global economy and the home of IBM's Quantum Computation Center. The innovations that the President saw today in Poughkeepsie will benefit directly from the CHIPS and Science Act, and all of us at IBM thank President Biden, Senator Schumer, and leaders across Washington who made this once-in-a-generation law possible. Learn more about IBM's plan to invest $20 billion in R&D across the Hudson Valley region over the next ten years.

Today, we‚Äôre doing it again. I‚Äôd like to reintroduce you to IBM.

IBM has taken decisive strategic actions to meet the unique needs of this moment, including our acquisition of Red Hat in 2019 and yesterday‚Äôs spinoff of our managed infrastructure services business, now known as Kyndryl. Read more about today‚Äôs IBM here.

In my recent LinkedIn article, I share my thoughts on why now more than ever technology leaders should be focused on privacy and confidential computing in digital experiences.

Almost 40 years ago, I came to IBM determined to make an impact on the world. Today, as I send my final letter to IBMers around the world, I cannot help but reflect on the impact that this company has had on me. In my final note, I revisit a few of the lessons I‚Äôve learned.

1. Never let anyone else define you.
2. Growth and comfort never coexist.
3. Work on something that matters.

As I step down from my role as executive chairman, IBM will still be part of my next chapter ‚Äî it will live on in the values and purpose it has instilled in me. I know that under's leadership, you will carry IBM ever onward, continuing play a role in shaping the products that help the world‚Äôs most essential organizations operate. To my IBMers, it has been the honor and privilege of a lifetime to work with all of you. I look forward to watching and cheering you on as you carry this great company into the future.
