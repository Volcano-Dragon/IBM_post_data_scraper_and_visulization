For example, if your

If AI isn‚Äôt using quality data, it can yield biased results. That‚Äôs why understanding how your AI is trained and what goes into its recommendations is key to building systems rooted in trust.

‚ú®Today, get to know our partner: Anantha Narayanan Varadharajan, CEO, SBA Info Solutions Pvt. Ltd. We value the long standing partnership of 15-20 years with SBA Info Solutions. Congratulations to SBA Info Solutions on their 30th Anniversary ! ‚ú® 

Anantha's favorite technology is mainframe computing and cognitive search for enterprises. "Mainframes provide the backbone of stability and scalability, and this is very crucial for the BFSI clients we work with", says Anantha. " I love cognitive search because it extracts actionable insights, ensuring organization's longevity and competitive edge in a world with increasing skill shortage. IBM Linuxone and discovery is something I believe has great potential to transform enterprises."

Anantha is spiritual and his work-life balance is filled with chanting vedic hymns. He finds solace and inspiration in the rhythmic recitation of Rudram. As Anantha avers, "this cherished practice not only serves as a personal sanctuary but also enhances my awareness and mindfulness in my Job as CEO."

About the long standing relationship with IBM, Anantha says " I like working with IBM for 2 reasons- technology and people. The sheer breadth of portfolio from compute/storage to new age generative AI , every product and platform has been exceptionally designed for enterprise and business users. We always look forward to their guidance and support during the best and challenging times. From implementing cyber resilient storage, to migrating oracle workloads to power and implementing Qradar for enhanced security posture, every engagement has been special and served as crucial milestones in SBA's trajectory. Now we've set our sights on Data and Artificial intelligence"

Thank you Anantha Narayanan Varadharajan and SBA Info Solutions Pvt. Ltd. team for your strong partnership in creating impact in

‚ú®Today, get to know our partner: Radhika Pillai, Co-Founder and Director Analytics, Algorisys Technologies Private Limited.

Radhika's favourite technology is IBM Planning Analytics with Watson. According to her, "it is a powerful tool that is ideal for finance professionals and non-financial stakeholders alike." ‚ú®

Radhika believes that IBM Planning Analytics intuitive interface makes it easy to collaborate seamlessly, and its dynamic reports and dashboards allow for the presentation of data-driven insights with ease. She finds, the predictive analytics feature particularly helpful in exploring different scenarios and making informed decisions. Overall, it is an essential tool that everyone should have access to. üìä

Radhika balances her extremely busy work schedule with cooking and reading. For her, it is therapeutic cooking where she gets to expand her creativity (especially with new recipes of cuisines across the world) as much as unwind. Reading, on the other hand, takes Radhika to different worlds and cultures, allowing her to broaden her horizons.üìö

Thank you, Radhika and Algorisys Technologies Private Limited team for your strong partnership in creating impact in India. üôå

üéì Today's episode of Reinvent Refresh we continue the conversation, showcasing the 'warriors' of 
hashtag
#IBMSKillsBuild - the teachers who go the distance with their unconditional support and drive to be a 'change catalyst'.

‚ÄúI always tell my students to enjoy problems‚Äù says Poornima madam while in conversation with, Vice President, Marketing & Communications, IBM Asia Pacific.

Meet Abbie üëã, an Application Developer based in Australia. This is her inspiring story of how the support she received from IBM and her colleagues empowered her to come out at work as a trans woman üè≥Ô∏è‚Äç‚ößÔ∏è.

It was August 2019 when she sent her coming out email to her colleagues. Immediately she was embraced with nothing but support, where people already made the effort to start using her new name üíô. This gave her the confidence she needed to also come out to more people in her personal life.

Abbie has gone through many changes since 2019 and her teammates continue to be there for her. For Abbie, being her authentic self at IBM, means she doesn‚Äôt need to hide the fact that she is trans - because there‚Äôs no need to.

üå∑Today, get to know our partner: Annette Henry, CEO, Clarita Solutions.

Annette's favourite technology is communication technologies. "What I appreciate the most are the capabilities of various modes of communication and how they have allowed a lot of people these days to be able to work anywhere, whether it is in the office or at home, and be able for them to still participate and collaborate in the same playing field."

üéæ On wellbeing and having a hobby to de-stress, Annette plays tennis every week. "I use that as a perfect excuse to get more exercise and as an opportunity to socialise with my life-long girlfriends who I have been playing tennis with for over a decade," says Annette.

Thank you Annette and Clarita Solutions for being our partner, driving innovation in ANZ! üëè
