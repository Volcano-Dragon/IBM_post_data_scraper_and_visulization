Mithila is a visual and UX design intern in Software based in IBM’s Kochi office in India. 🇮🇳 While she only joined IBM several weeks ago, she says it has already been an incredible journey of self-discovery and growth, immersing herself in a culture that values curiosity, learning, and diversity.

Professionally, IBM has been a catalyst for her development, empowering her to explore passions within brand design and illustration.

Mithila says witnessing women in leadership roles inspires her to be more assertive and confident in decision-making, so here’s her advice for interns:

🌷 Stay authentic and accountable
🌷 Tech evolves fast; be ready to adapt
🌷 Embrace feedback; keep that curiosity alive

Outside of work, her biggest inspiration is her mom, whose sacrifices have shaped her journey.

Few use-cases are processing of financial instruments, trade finance, invoices, receipts, insurance claims & underwriting, itemized bills in healthcare.

According to, CEO,"AI empowers banks to navigate complexities in Trade Finance by identifying discrepancies and enhancing risk assessment, resulting in smoother Import-Export transactions."

, MD, Financial Services Digital Transformation, IBM, says " Exponential technologies like hybrid cloud, AI are opening up a world of new opportunities for banks and fintechs alike to innovate and grow."

Here comes bizAmica's izDOX AI Platform built on IBM Cloud. The izDOX is an AI based platform that auto identifies and classifies document types. Some may think of using OCR however there is a need of more than OCR to get the validated data.

Having a 
hashtag
#mentor can be a career changer 🚀 This 
hashtag
#MentoringMonth, meet Marqueta, IBM Business Transformation Consultant and veteran, who volunteers to mentor underrepresented communities in tech.

👉 During her transition from the military to a corporate role, Marqueta felt she lacked support. At IBM, Marqueta started volunteering for Career Conversations to mentor
learners and help provide the guidance she wished she'd had as she navigated her career transition.

When asked about her experience with her mentee, Marqueta said, "It has been wonderful! I check in with my mentee quite often to see if she needs a listening ear, my feedback on something, or just questions about transiting from active duty to a corporate role."

"Hi I’m Matt, a backend engineer for IBM Cloud. ☁️

I’ve always enjoyed the principles of technology and knew that computer science was the right field for me. 💻

Now, I’m most proud of creating a software tool that will help us diagnose problems more quickly and allow us to recover from incidents with less downtime. 🔧

When I’m not writing code for the IBM Cloud platform, I’m often leading projects for JumpStart, which is IBM’s career development program for entry-level engineers. My JumpStart team helped design and test wireless networking capabilities for IBM’s Liquid Prep system which is a low-cost system of soil moisture sensors that helps drought-stricken farmers water their crops more effectively." 🌱💧

#DYK: Only 6% of Asia Pacific organizations are driving transformational business value?

A new IBM-sponsored study by IDC of 600 companies across 17 industries in Asia Pacific (AP) explored the key success metrics that organizations are using to measure value from their digital investments.

* 71% of AP organizations struggle to drive transformational business value from digital investments.
* 47% have established basic capabilities and near-term departmental strategies to drive joint external value.
* 24% are still predominantly focused on internal financial value and metrics; digital investments are short-sighted and narrowly defined.

"Hello! I am Alok Raj, an SAP ABAP Consultant based in Noida. I joined IBM in 2021, and it has been nearly three years since then, but it still feels as though I joined just yesterday. This feeling persists because I truly enjoy the work I do, and the support from my team is exceptional.

There is immense satisfaction in comprehending an end-to-end real-time problem after discussing it with end-users and functional teams and subsequently solving it. Besides the work itself, the most exciting aspect is the potential for learning new technologies and how to integrate them into our existing systems to address various challenges.

In my role as an SAP ABAP Consultant, I have primarily focused on MM, SD, FI, and HR and in my view nowadays SAP ABAP Consultants need to prioritize learning RAP and BTP, as well as exploring how to leverage existing resources like OData, CDS View, and Workflow in these technologies. Additionally, incorporating IoT devices into our existing systems is a significant area of interest.

IBM is a fantastic place to work, offering a great work-life balance. It provides access to numerous portals and resources for learning about new technologies and exploring them. I do believe that there are ample opportunities to translate this learning into practical experience by tackling real-time challenges. Learning alone, without applying it to solve real-world problems, doesn't contribute significantly. Therefore, it is crucial to establish a framework for evaluating our skills on a regular basis and providing corresponding opportunities.”

At IBM, we believe that great opportunities are not only found, but created. If you're passionate about SAP and are looking for a work environment where your skills can shine like never before, we have an opportunity for you:

Meet Sejal Sonchhatra, an SAP Analytics Architect and SAP Women in Technology (WIT) Leader at the Customer Innovation Center (CIC). Her story is not just about her role as an architect but also about breaking stereotypes and paving the way for women in tech!

Sejal is conquering the challenges many women face in the tech world. She's open and inspiring when discussing these hurdles.

What sets Sejal apart? She values skills and potential over gender and has supportive leaders who see her talents and encourage her to reach for the stars. From tech wizard as a Subject Matter Expert (SME) to architect, manager, mentor, and now SAP-WIT Leader, she takes on challenging roles headfirst.

Her secret to success? A commitment to self-improvement and a thirst for knowledge to stay at the forefront of the ever-changing tech world. She's on a mission to inspire teams to believe that continuous learning is the key to excelling in tech. She says, it's not just about technical skills; you've got to understand the business, the industry, and the magic of teamwork. She sees the bigger picture and knows that success in tech goes beyond just being a techie!

Sejal is a fierce advocate for gender diversity, not just as a box to tick but as a result of nurturing talent and meritocracy. She knows that women, like her, are multitasking maestros, able to blend the demands of a tech career with the joys of family life, even in the face of pandemic changes. She underscores the importance of "me" time and family time for a fulfilling life.

Just like Sejal, take control of your future and let IBM help you achieve your full potential! We're hiring SAP Developers, Architects, and Consultants in various locations in India.

Hey! 👋 I'm Reshmi, an Automation Test Specialist at IBM Kochi, in the beautiful state of Kerala, India.

I have developed automation frameworks which make testing applications really efficient and easy.I am really proud of the way my career is progressing after joining IBM, and I am so happy I made this decision.

I vividly remember the excitement I felt when I learned that Big Blue was coming into my hometown. I have the opportunity to interact and work with consultants from various parts of the world and I'm getting more exposure to the latest technologies and tools. This has greatly improved my skills and overall knowledge. I am grateful to have mentors who guide me on how to succeed and progress in my career and we have a great working relationship.

One aspect that I find truly thrilling about working at IBM is the opportunity to showcase my talents. Whether it's through coding or singing, I've had the chance to participate in various events as part of the IBM Music Club. It brings me immense pleasure to combine my passions with my work.

Another aspect that sets IBM apart is the work-life balance it offers. As a working mother of two, this is incredibly important to me. Now I know it's possible to have it all IF you are in the right organization!

Be true authentic yourself with IBM! Apply now and be part of something amazing.Find your next job 👉

Hi 🙋! I am Mithula, an Electronic Design Automation Engineer from Bangalore!

I work on enabling cutting edge semiconductor technology nodes used in the design of processor chips that drive the IBM Power and Mainframe Systems. I started my career with IBM in 2005 and have witnessed the innovations and advancement across several generations of chips from 270nm down to the latest 7nm node.
There has always been something new to learn every day!🌟

I have had the privilege of working with worldwide development, design, research and technology teams which has helped me to grow both professionally and personally. One of the most thrilling moments at work is when all the complex work finally comes together in the form of tiny chips that we get to hold once they are fabricated!

What I value the most about IBM is the incredible set of people that I get to interact with every day. From new hires to technical experts, Distinguished Engineers and IBM Fellows, the shared enthusiasm, passion and the collaborative environment makes work truly enjoyable. I cherish the relationship built with my colleagues over the years.

We have lots of fun at our workplace with several events and activities organized throughout the year, which brings the whole team together. Outside of work, I enjoy travelling and exploring new places and love playing board games with my family. 😉

As an IBMer at India Systems Development Lab, it has been an enriching journey so far and I am very excited to discover all the magic that lies ahead!

Ready to make a difference? Apply now and join our team of change-makers.

Semiconductors, AI, and quantum computing are among the most consequential technologies in the world, and IBM is at the heart of them all. As the G7 convenes in Japan, today I had the great honor of representing IBM in an unprecedented gathering of all the key leaders of the global semiconductor industry with Prime Minister Kishida of Japan. IBM is the strategic technology partner of Rapidus, Japan’s national project to revive advanced logic manufacturing. I was pleased to share with the Prime Minister our extended track record of successful joint development efforts in semiconductors, as well as our resolve and commitment to create a more vibrant and geographically secure supply chain for the world.

I also discussed our growing partnership with Japan in quantum computing. A few weeks ago, we announced that by the end of this year, the 127 qubit IBM Eagle processor will be installed at the. It will be the most powerful quantum computer in all of Asia. And just yesterday,published an article highlighting a new $100 million commitment from IBM to establish a partnership between the, the University of Tokyo, and, to pioneer the era of quantum-centric supercomputing. It will be formally announced during the G7, and it is designed to drive the fundamental advances required to build a 100,000 qubit machine that will seamlessly integrate classical and quantum information within the coming decade.

IBM will continue to support the Japanese semiconductor and next-gen computing industries to ensure they are a success, driving a bright and sustainable future for Japan and for the world.

Happy Pan-Asian Heritage Month everyone! This month, we celebrate the rich and diverse cultures, traditions, and histories of the Pan-Asian community. As we reflect on the contributions and achievements of Pan-Asians, let us also recognize the challenges and struggles that they have faced and continue to face.

To mark Pan-Asian Heirtage Month, Varun shares his experience as an Asian American IBMer of Indian origin, and some tips on how we can all take the first steps to allyship. Read Varun's story in our new blog:

So let us, also, use this as an opportunity to educate ourselves and others about the Pan-Asian experience and work towards creating a more inclusive and equitable society.

Hey, my name is Cristina! I am a Content Developer and Designer for IBM Z and I like to say that my career, in a nutshell, is turning "geek to chic." The focus of my work is turning technical information into interesting, engaging, and easily consumable content. I love coming up with creative ways to engage the community and creating compelling content that resonates with our target audiences!

Pan-Asian Heritage Month is a time when I feel it is especially important to voice my opinions and experiences as an Asian-American. I’m grateful that IBM has created a welcoming and supportive space for me, and other people of Pan-Asian Heritage, to be our full authentic selves—not just this month, but year-round.

I like to recognize and celebrate this month by learning new Asian cuisine recipes—like my Sichuan Chili Oil recipe, which I filmed and presented to my fellow IBMers!

Are you looking for a place where you're empowered to be your authentic self? Let's connect. ➡️

Let us know in the comments below how you're recognizing Pan-Asian Heritage Month. ⬇️

Hi, I’m Mady.👋 I’m a Junior Application Developer in the Client Innovation Centre (CIC) IBM Romania!

Starting my career journey with IBM as an intern, I was supported and provided with endless learning opportunities. This resulted in a promotion to Junior Application Developer in just under three months! 🎉 IBM's internal learning platform has helped me expand my skills and ability in other programming languages, such as Android, Java, which I had no knowledge of before… but currently, I’m using it to complete my final project in college. 🎓

The work that I do at IBM is inspiring! I get to contribute on projects for top companies within IBM’s portfolio using PL/SQL technology, which I learnt in college whilst also applying programming languages I've learned since joining IBM. Being able to see the real life impact my work has, using my pre-existing and acquired skills has been so rewarding!

My top tip for success in this role is passion — make sure you're passionate about the work you're doing as that ensures you will always succeed. Having studied PL/SQL in college and realizing that I’m proficient at it and enjoyed this technology solidified that I wanted to make a future out of it. 🤓

As an employer, IBM is a company where I can express myself. I love doing designs on my nails, dying my hair, as well as graphic eyeliner and creative make up! IBM gives you the freedom to be who you want to be whilst doing work that reflects your interests. 💜 💄 💅 💇‍♀️

Meet Ameera, Senior Infrastructure Specialist, who joined IBM through the Tech Re-Entry program — a full-time, paid returnship program for technical professionals who took a break from the workforce, and are looking to restart their careers.

When Ameera took a fresh start with IBM after a five-year career break, she felt that her skills were outdated with the latest technologies. But with her resiliency and eagerness to learn, she re-acquired the technical skills needed to be successful in her role after just six months of joining the program.

If you’re ready to take the leap back into tech, head to our careers site for information on open opportunities in the Tech Re-entry program 👉

Meet Miriam, a Business Technology Leader in our Client Engineering team based in Berlin, Germany. 

After finishing her bachelor’s degree, Miriam didn’t want to stop learning. She found the Master@IBM program, which allowed her to work while doing her Master’s degree at the same time. Her thesis on Women and Diversity in Tech inspired her to host and speak at inclusive events at IBM and beyond — inspiring women and underrepresented groups globally to pursue a career in technology and change the face of the industry for good.

“I enjoy making connections with people, technology, and languages. IBM allows me to make connections across the industry, and make more of a difference — that’s something I just find so inspiring,” said Miriam.

As Miriam juggles work, life, and continuous learning, there is no doubt she is defining what’s possible. Take the first step of joining a team of great IBMers, like her, by signing up for our talent network. There, you can be the first to hear about new job opportunities. 👉

“Always have the courage to try, as you never know just how good you can be until you dive in.”

Lisa, who has been an IBMer for an incredible 19 years, works as the Area Leader for Custom Data Managed Services in Australia. An inspiration to many, she juggles work, parenting and professional sports, but says the three activities are pretty similar: planning, determination and having an empathetic support system helps, all of which can be found at IBM.

Meet Ryoko, Senior Project Manager at IBM Consulting in Japan. 

After returning to work from her maternity leave, Ryoko really felt that the whole organization provided her with the support she needed to be able to juggle being a working mom based on her capacity.

It was very meaningful for her to be able to see her senior leaders, who were mothers, working right next to her. As she gradually moved away from childcare, she was encouraged to take on more challenges, such as being assigned as the Leader of the Applications team.

For Ryoko, her children are more important than anything else — and she wondered, “are all of the working parents devoting themselves to their work at the expense of their families and children?” But she realized that was not the case.

IBM’s flexibility allows working parents, like Ryoko, to adjust their schedules to meet family needs. For Ryoko, it makes her want to do her best, too.

“Hello everyone! My name is Chikako and I’m a Research Scientist who is part of the Tokyo-based unit that develops AI hardware accelerators.

I’m a ﬁrm believer in 'blooming where you're planted' 🌱 – always making the most of what you do. Right now, I am particularly proud to be doing research that may one day shape the future of the world, alongside a team of wonderful, supportive colleagues.

Teamwork and being able to communicate with people is the best. I think I'm the happiest at work when I can rely on others while others rely on me. People will sometimes ask me what kind of career I want to pursue or whether I want to become a leader, but I just want to be a person who works with and relies on others. It's why I chose this job. I love teamwork, and teamwork is why I love IBM.” 💙

The global AI market is expected to surpass $500 billion in 2023.

As AI adoption expands, ethical compliance remains a significant challenge. According to several global surveys, responsible AI maturity remains a blind spot for most businesses.

, Head of AI, nasscom says, "AI will enable social transformation at scale only if the developers and adopters of this disruptive technology demonstrate an unwavering commitment to user trust and safety."

adoption could enable businesses to address rising trust and safety concerns around AI.

IBM together with nasscom is working towards building Trustworthy AI to be used for social good.

Did you know the 1967 IBM Advanced System 4/Pi series was named after its “full sphere” of performance characteristics? The small but mighty computer was used onboard NASA’s shuttle missions. 🚀 Happy

“I wanted a place where I'd be welcomed and lots of "just come as you are" vibes – not having to hide yourself – being unapologetically you. I'm heavily involved in the Women in Technology group here in Raleigh where we bring girl scouts to the office, so that they can discover how fun and fascinating technology can be. I want to challenge people who don't think they're creative to come up with innovative ideas since I always want to inspire people." - ShuDon, IBM USA.

Your path at IBM may surprise you; even without a tech background, you can find yourself eager to work in tech. Like Michelle, who after studying communications and journalism, took a somewhat non-traditional route, interning at IBM as a technical writer.

Since then, she has progressed to the position of Staff Content Designer and even spends time advocating for women in STEM as co-manager of the IBM STEM for Girls Camp. Michelle's skills in arts and social sciences gives her a unique view - as well as the ability to create compelling content. Now, she's ready to keep learning and see what the future holds.

El Profundo Impacto de la Inteligencia Artificial.

Vivimos en la era de la IA en todo lugar. Su uso se ha convertido en algo común en la sociedad y los negocios. Todos los días, confiamos en la IA para tareas como completar automáticamente nuestros mensajes de texto, ayudarnos a elegir una ruta hacia una ubicación y recomendarnos la próxima película que debemos ver o la canción que debemos escuchar.

Más allá de estos usos cotidianos, las empresas también utilizan IA para transformar sus procesos y ser más eficientes. Las organizaciones desean mejorar indicadores claves para su negocio como reducir costos, automatizar procesos, optimizar operaciones, innovar, mejorar la experiencia de clientes, aumentar las capacidades de ciberseguridad, entre otros.

Actualmente, las áreas que más usan IA en las organizaciones son las encargadas de la tecnología y los datos. Con la transformación digital estas áreas han ganado una gran relevancia, pues son las encargadas de habilitar dichas transformaciones.

Para conocer más sobre el impacto de la inteligencia artificial en las empresas lee el artículo de Román Zambrano, CTO IBM Argentina, Paraguay y Uruguay:

"I have been told that one of my biggest strengths is leading with vulnerability. I truly believe it creates a stronger trust between colleagues as well as a better team. Sometimes when people look at leaders, they think we've got it all together. That we've solved every problem. And I think that's the ﬂaw – why don't leaders talk about their mistakes and shortcomings as much as their successes? We don't know everything, we all struggle, and I think there's a lot of beauty in that vulnerability.”

Jace, Vice President of HR for Finance and Operations is always looking to use her experience to help other people grow. In her 14 years as an IBMer so far, she's done it all, from starting a book club to testifying in front of Congress. Diversity is really important to Jace because of her Native American heritage, and she's proud to work at a company that stands for what she believes in.

Do you specialize in Cloud? ☁️ Then read this story from one of IBM Consulting's architects doing really cool things with 
hashtag
#OpenShift.

Daiki, who is based in Tokyo 🇯🇵, joined IBM in 2017 and worked his way up from IT Specialist to now an Architect in IBM Consulting.

So how does Cloud intertwine with his story? Well, that's the area he specializes in! OpenShift is a cloud-based container platform and the commercial version of
. It is one of the Red Hat’s flagship products. Daiki improves the various conditions and constraints he comes across to maximize the effectiveness of OpenShift, so that the clients' systems evolve... ultimately, driving our clients' business forward.

Daiki uses open source technology to make our banking clients better and more secure. 🔒

Pretty cool, right? Plus, he works with developers and operators to enhance them with OpenShift’s capabilities and features. He also helps them understand how they can improve their work.

Daiki's story is one where technology and collaboration intersect. And that collaboration is beyond just with our clients -- it's with his IBMer colleagues, too. Daiki says IBMers are keen to sharing knowledge with one another to help each other grow. With so many IBMers to learn from, the possibilities for you to grow with us are boundless.

Interested in tech jobs, like Daiki's?
