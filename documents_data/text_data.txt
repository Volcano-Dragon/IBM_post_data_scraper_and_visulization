Research published by IBM Quantum in @Nature today has taken us into the era of quantum utility. In a collaboration between scientists at IBM Quantum and UC Berkeley, this landmark paper shows evidence that a quantum computer, powered by the IBM Quantum Eagle 127-qubit processor, has produced accurate results for problems beyond the reach of leading classical approaches.

Following this achievement, we are also announcing that our IBM Quantum Systems will be powered by a minimum of 127 qubits.

Celebrating 
hashtag
#PrideMonth with former IBMer and LGBTQ+ activist Edith Windsor! üåà

Edith joined IBM as a programmer in 1958, where she worked for 16 years while advancing IBM systems like the 7040 and System/360.

However, it is Edith's immense societal impact that truly defines her legacy.

Edith played a critical role in the Supreme Court‚Äôs decision to overturn Section 3 of the Defense of Marriage Act in 2013. This landmark victory helped set a series of other cases in motion, ultimately ending the federal ban on same-sex marriages in 2016.

Today, we honor Edith's unwavering courage, resilience, and tireless advocacy for equality. Her remarkable journey serves as a testament to an individual‚Äôs ability to shape history.

Why are consultants choosing IBM as their next destination in their career? We went looking for answers from consultants at IBM Consulting who work in a variety of industries, and here's what they said:

1Ô∏è‚É£ IBM encourages growth.

2Ô∏è‚É£ We're committed to diversity, equity, and inclusion.

3Ô∏è‚É£ We work with a variety of innovative clients ‚Äì from smaller, family-owned businesses to Fortune 500 companies.

4Ô∏è‚É£ While we have world-class expertise in developing and delivering technology solutions, we have several areas that don‚Äôt require the deep technical skills of a developer or an engineer -- so we have careers for a variety of skillsets.

5Ô∏è‚É£ Having been at the forefront of technology and innovation for over 100 years, IBM is a name people know and trust, so our impact spans globally across many industries and causes.

So Consultants -- what makes you stay at IBM?
