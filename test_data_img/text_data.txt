Mithila is a visual and UX design intern in Software based in IBM’s Kochi office in India. 🇮🇳 While she only joined IBM several weeks ago, she says it has already been an incredible journey of self-discovery and growth, immersing herself in a culture that values curiosity, learning, and diversity.

Professionally, IBM has been a catalyst for her development, empowering her to explore passions within brand design and illustration.

Mithila says witnessing women in leadership roles inspires her to be more assertive and confident in decision-making, so here’s her advice for interns:

🌷 Stay authentic and accountable
🌷 Tech evolves fast; be ready to adapt
🌷 Embrace feedback; keep that curiosity alive

Outside of work, her biggest inspiration is her mom, whose sacrifices have shaped her journey.

Going digital is necessary but extracting information from all digital documents may need manual interventions.
 
Few use-cases are processing of financial instruments, trade finance, invoices, receipts, insurance claims & underwriting, itemized bills in healthcare.

According to, CEO,"AI empowers banks to navigate complexities in Trade Finance by identifying discrepancies and enhancing risk assessment, resulting in smoother Import-Export transactions."

, MD, Financial Services Digital Transformation, IBM, says " Exponential technologies like hybrid cloud, AI are opening up a world of new opportunities for banks and fintechs alike to innovate and grow."

Here comes bizAmica's izDOX AI Platform built on IBM Cloud. The izDOX is an AI based platform that auto identifies and classifies document types. Some may think of using OCR however there is a need of more than OCR to get the validated data.

Having a 
hashtag
#mentor can be a career changer 🚀 This 
hashtag
#MentoringMonth, meet Marqueta, IBM Business Transformation Consultant and veteran, who volunteers to mentor underrepresented communities in tech.

👉 During her transition from the military to a corporate role, Marqueta felt she lacked support. At IBM, Marqueta started volunteering for Career Conversations to mentor
learners and help provide the guidance she wished she'd had as she navigated her career transition.

When asked about her experience with her mentee, Marqueta said, "It has been wonderful! I check in with my mentee quite often to see if she needs a listening ear, my feedback on something, or just questions about transiting from active duty to a corporate role."

"Hi I’m Matt, a backend engineer for IBM Cloud. ☁️

I’ve always enjoyed the principles of technology and knew that computer science was the right field for me. 💻

Now, I’m most proud of creating a software tool that will help us diagnose problems more quickly and allow us to recover from incidents with less downtime. 🔧

When I’m not writing code for the IBM Cloud platform, I’m often leading projects for JumpStart, which is IBM’s career development program for entry-level engineers. My JumpStart team helped design and test wireless networking capabilities for IBM’s Liquid Prep system which is a low-cost system of soil moisture sensors that helps drought-stricken farmers water their crops more effectively." 🌱💧

#DYK: Only 6% of Asia Pacific organizations are driving transformational business value?

A new IBM-sponsored study by IDC of 600 companies across 17 industries in Asia Pacific (AP) explored the key success metrics that organizations are using to measure value from their digital investments.

* 71% of AP organizations struggle to drive transformational business value from digital investments.
* 47% have established basic capabilities and near-term departmental strategies to drive joint external value.
* 24% are still predominantly focused on internal financial value and metrics; digital investments are short-sighted and narrowly defined.

"Hello! I am Alok Raj, an SAP ABAP Consultant based in Noida. I joined IBM in 2021, and it has been nearly three years since then, but it still feels as though I joined just yesterday. This feeling persists because I truly enjoy the work I do, and the support from my team is exceptional. 

There is immense satisfaction in comprehending an end-to-end real-time problem after discussing it with end-users and functional teams and subsequently solving it. Besides the work itself, the most exciting aspect is the potential for learning new technologies and how to integrate them into our existing systems to address various challenges.

In my role as an SAP ABAP Consultant, I have primarily focused on MM, SD, FI, and HR and in my view nowadays SAP ABAP Consultants need to prioritize learning RAP and BTP, as well as exploring how to leverage existing resources like OData, CDS View, and Workflow in these technologies. Additionally, incorporating IoT devices into our existing systems is a significant area of interest.

IBM is a fantastic place to work, offering a great work-life balance. It provides access to numerous portals and resources for learning about new technologies and exploring them. I do believe that there are ample opportunities to translate this learning into practical experience by tackling real-time challenges. Learning alone, without applying it to solve real-world problems, doesn't contribute significantly. Therefore, it is crucial to establish a framework for evaluating our skills on a regular basis and providing corresponding opportunities.”

At IBM, we believe that great opportunities are not only found, but created. If you're passionate about SAP and are looking for a work environment where your skills can shine like never before, we have an opportunity for you:

Meet Sejal Sonchhatra, an SAP Analytics Architect and SAP Women in Technology (WIT) Leader at the Customer Innovation Center (CIC). Her story is not just about her role as an architect but also about breaking stereotypes and paving the way for women in tech!

Sejal is conquering the challenges many women face in the tech world. She's open and inspiring when discussing these hurdles.

What sets Sejal apart? She values skills and potential over gender and has supportive leaders who see her talents and encourage her to reach for the stars. From tech wizard as a Subject Matter Expert (SME) to architect, manager, mentor, and now SAP-WIT Leader, she takes on challenging roles headfirst.

Her secret to success? A commitment to self-improvement and a thirst for knowledge to stay at the forefront of the ever-changing tech world. She's on a mission to inspire teams to believe that continuous learning is the key to excelling in tech. She says, it's not just about technical skills; you've got to understand the business, the industry, and the magic of teamwork. She sees the bigger picture and knows that success in tech goes beyond just being a techie!

Sejal is a fierce advocate for gender diversity, not just as a box to tick but as a result of nurturing talent and meritocracy. She knows that women, like her, are multitasking maestros, able to blend the demands of a tech career with the joys of family life, even in the face of pandemic changes. She underscores the importance of "me" time and family time for a fulfilling life.

Just like Sejal, take control of your future and let IBM help you achieve your full potential! We're hiring SAP Developers, Architects, and Consultants in various locations in India.

Hey! 👋 I'm Reshmi, an Automation Test Specialist at IBM Kochi, in the beautiful state of Kerala, India.

I have developed automation frameworks which make testing applications really efficient and easy.I am really proud of the way my career is progressing after joining IBM, and I am so happy I made this decision.

I vividly remember the excitement I felt when I learned that Big Blue was coming into my hometown. I have the opportunity to interact and work with consultants from various parts of the world and I'm getting more exposure to the latest technologies and tools. This has greatly improved my skills and overall knowledge. I am grateful to have mentors who guide me on how to succeed and progress in my career and we have a great working relationship.

One aspect that I find truly thrilling about working at IBM is the opportunity to showcase my talents. Whether it's through coding or singing, I've had the chance to participate in various events as part of the IBM Music Club. It brings me immense pleasure to combine my passions with my work.

Another aspect that sets IBM apart is the work-life balance it offers. As a working mother of two, this is incredibly important to me. Now I know it's possible to have it all IF you are in the right organization!

Be true authentic yourself with IBM! Apply now and be part of something amazing.Find your next job 👉

Hi 🙋! I am Mithula, an Electronic Design Automation Engineer from Bangalore!

I work on enabling cutting edge semiconductor technology nodes used in the design of processor chips that drive the IBM Power and Mainframe Systems. I started my career with IBM in 2005 and have witnessed the innovations and advancement across several generations of chips from 270nm down to the latest 7nm node.
There has always been something new to learn every day!🌟

I have had the privilege of working with worldwide development, design, research and technology teams which has helped me to grow both professionally and personally. One of the most thrilling moments at work is when all the complex work finally comes together in the form of tiny chips that we get to hold once they are fabricated!

What I value the most about IBM is the incredible set of people that I get to interact with every day. From new hires to technical experts, Distinguished Engineers and IBM Fellows, the shared enthusiasm, passion and the collaborative environment makes work truly enjoyable. I cherish the relationship built with my colleagues over the years.

We have lots of fun at our workplace with several events and activities organized throughout the year, which brings the whole team together. Outside of work, I enjoy travelling and exploring new places and love playing board games with my family. 😉

As an IBMer at India Systems Development Lab, it has been an enriching journey so far and I am very excited to discover all the magic that lies ahead!

Ready to make a difference? Apply now and join our team of change-makers.
